# CinePreview_backend
This repo contain backend code for movie review application.

## what I build and which problem I want to solve.

Being a huge fan of movies, I decided to put my tech skills to good use by crafting a web application that tracks all the flicks I've already indulged in and those that I can't wait to feast my eyes on.

# Tech stack- React.js, SpringBoot & MongoDB.


### Why CinePreview ?
It combines the words "Cinema" (referring to movies) and "Preview" (referring to the trailers), and has a catchy ring to it. The name also implies that users can get a sneak peek at movies trailer and add their thoughts on them through reviews.
