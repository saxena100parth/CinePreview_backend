## what I build and which problem I want to solve.

Being a huge fan of movies, I decided to put my tech skills to good use by crafting a web application that tracks all the flicks I've already indulged in and those that I can't wait to feast my eyes on.

# Tech stack- React.js, SpringBoot & MongoDB.
MongoDB for the database, Java and Spring Boot for the back end, and React for the front end.

# Features


### Why CinePreview ?
It combines the words "Cinema" (referring to movies) and "Preview" (referring to the trailers), and has a catchy ring to it. The name also implies that users can get a sneak peek at movies trailer and add their thoughts on them through reviews.

### Also used:
Railway - for deploying backend. <br>
GitHub-pages - for deploying frontend. <br>
MongoDB Atlas - for cloud MongoDB database. <br>
Maven - build automation tool. <br>
tmdb.org - a website which provides free to use API for development, I use it for posters of movies. <br>
